> How to run this example

After you've git cloned the repository and are in the `examples/welcome_ruby` directory you'll need to run a few commands.

```sh
bundle install
npm install

node hypernova.js
```

...and in a separate shell:

```sh
bin/rails server
```

"Hello, Hypernova!" will show up at http://localhost:3000/.
